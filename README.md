## Phase 1
During the first phase I:
- declared global CSS variables (color, type, spacing)
- laid out the elements in a flex-box grid to see them all side-by-side
- developed the overall feel of the site

## Phase 2
I don't often develop mobile-first, but I gave it a go for this challenge. 

Phase 2 was all about starting with a mobile-first design so that users could navigate through different parts of the solar system on a mobile device.

## Phase 3
The last phase of this design:
- built on the mobile design, but laid out elements side-by-side so they were easier to view on a desktop resolution
- integrated transitions
- refined the design with some fun CSS gradient tricks
- implemented a different font
